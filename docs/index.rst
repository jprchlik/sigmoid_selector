   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sigmoid_Catalog's documentation!

Sigmoids, aptly named for their S-shaped coronal field lines,
frequently produce both Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and flares,
which are drivers of space weather at Earth.
Space weather may cause everything from aurorae to power black outs,
so studying Sigmoids is partically important.
Along with their practical importance, 
Sigmoids are likely due to theortically proposed flux ropes.
As such, studying Sigmoids has practical and physical benefits.

The initial sigmoid catalog `(Savcheva et al. 2014) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/2014SoPh..289.3297S>`_
contains 79 sigmoids discovered by searching twice daily syntopic Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations between 2007 and 2012 (`catalog webpage <http://aia.cfa.harvard.edu/sigmoid/>`_).
Version 2 of the catalog, of which the code is detailed here, expands the initial Sigmoid Catalog to 2017.
This expansion creates a database of more than 300 sigmoids.
In addition, we measure new parameters, not in the first iteration of the catalog.
Here I will detail the code used to analyze Sigmoids in version 2 of the Sigmoid Catalog.
