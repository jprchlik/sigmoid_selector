create_combined_movies
======================

Takes the movies made by make_hmi_movie, aia_movie/make_aia_movie, and make_aia_flare_movies and combines them into one directory based on their IAU indentification number. Currently, creates new directories in combined_movies path then symbolic links to the movies in the other directories.
